Using traffic stop data released by Institute for Municipal and Regional Policy at Central Connecticut State University, I used [flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) and [collapsibleTree](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/collapsibleTree/index.html) to create an interactive storyboard to breakdown traffic stops across CT by racial group, reason for stop, and outcome of stop. This study was a part of The Racial Profiling Prohibition Project in partnership with the Institute for Municipal and Regional Policy, out of CCSU.
